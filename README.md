Project Steps

Phase 1: Project Definition and Design Thinking

Project Definition: The project involves analyzing water quality data to assess the suitability of water for specific purposes, such as drinking. The objective is to identify potential issues or deviations from regulatory standards and determine water potability based on various parameters. This project includes defining analysis objectives, collecting water quality data, designing relevant visualizations, and building a predictive model.

Design Thinking:

Analysis Objectives: Define specific objectives for analyzing water quality data, including assessing potability, identifying deviations from standards, and understanding parameter relationships.
Data Collection: Gather the provided water quality data containing parameters like pH, Hardness, Solids, etc.
Visualization Strategy: Plan how to visualize parameter distributions, correlations, and potability using suitable tools.
Predictive Modeling: Decide on the machine learning algorithms and features to use for predicting water potability.

Phase 2: Innovation

Consider exploring anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns in water quality parameters.

Phase 3: Development Part 1

Start building the water quality analysis by preprocessing the data and performing exploratory data analysis.

Phase 4: Development Part 2

Continue building the analysis by creating visualizations and building a predictive model.

Phase 5: Project Documentation & Submission

Document the water quality analysis project and prepare it for submission.
